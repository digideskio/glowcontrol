    "received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br>" +
    "General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br>" +
    "General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>" +
"<br>" +
      "If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br>" +
    "whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br>" +
